            <p>Root canal treatment is performed to repair the damaged, decayed or infected teeth. The affected nerves and pulp are cleaned and sealed in this treatment and the teeth are repaired.</p><br>
<p>Root canal treatment is a dental procedure that is used to repair and save a damaged or infected tooth. The procedure involves removing the infected pulp from the inside of the tooth and then filling and sealing the tooth.</p><br>
<p>name hospital, Advanced Dental Hospitals is a leading dental clinic in rjy, India, that offers root canal treatment. The clinic has a team of experienced and qualified dentists who can help you determine if you need root canal treatment and perform the procedure safely and effectively.</p><br>
<h3>When Is Root Canal Treatment Necessary?</h3>
<p>Root canal treatment may be necessary if you have:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. A deep cavity that has infected the pulp of the tooth</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A cracked or chipped tooth that has allowed bacteria to enter the pulp</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. A tooth that has been injured and the pulp is damaged</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. A tooth that has a large filling that has caused the pulp to become damaged or infected</p>


<h3>symptoms that may indicate a tooth needs root canal treatment:</h3><br>

<p>1. Severe Tooth Pain: Persistent or severe tooth pain, especially when chewing or applying pressure, can indicate the nerve and pulp are inflamed or infected.</p>
<p>2. Sensitivity to Heat or Cold: Increased sensitivity to hot or cold temperatures that lingers after the stimulus is removed can be a sign of damaged pulp.</p>
<p>3. Swelling: Swelling in the gums around the affected tooth, which may be tender to the touch, can indicate an infection.</p>
<p>4. Discoloration: Discoloration (darkening) of the tooth compared to the surrounding teeth may occur if the nerve tissue inside the tooth is dying.</p>


<p>5. Gum Pimples or Abscess: A recurring pimple-like swelling on the gums, which may discharge pus or blood, can be a sign of infection.</p>
<p>6. Tenderness or Swelling in Nearby Gums: Painful or swollen gums around the affected tooth can indicate an infection has spread beyond the  tooth.</p>
<p>7. Loose Tooth: A tooth that feels loose or unstable in the socket, unrelated to an injury, may indicate root damage.</p>
<p>8. Cracked or Damaged Tooth: A cracked or chipped tooth can expose the nerve and pulp to bacteria, leading to inflammation and infection.</p><br>


<h3>How Is Root Canal Treatment Done?</h3>

<p>Root canal treatment is typically done in two or three appointments. During the first appointment, the dentist will numb the area around the tooth and then drill a small hole in the top of the tooth. The dentist will then use a series of thin instruments to remove the infected pulp from the inside of the tooth.</p>

<p>Once the pulp has been removed, the dentist will clean and disinfect the inside of the tooth. The dentist will then fill the tooth with a rubber-like material and seal it with a filling or crown.</p>

<p>If the tooth is severely damaged, the dentist may need to place a post inside the tooth to support the filling or crown. The post will help to reinforce the tooth and prevent it from cracking or breaking.</p><br>

<h3>Benefits of Root Canal Treatment:</h3><br>

<p>it provides relief from severe tooth pain caused by deep decay, infection, or trauma.</p>
<p>By removing the infected pulp tissue and cleaning the root canal system, the procedure alleviates discomfort and prevents the spread of infection to neighboring teeth</p>
<p>Additionally, preserving the natural tooth through root canal treatment helps maintain proper chewing function and prevents the need for extraction, which can lead to further dental complications and the necessity for costly tooth replacement options like implants or bridges</p>
<p>Furthermore, this treatment helps restore the tooth's normal appearance and functionality with the placement of a crown or filling, ensuring a natural and aesthetically pleasing result. </p>
